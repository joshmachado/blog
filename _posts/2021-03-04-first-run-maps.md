## Tracking Running Routes

I had the idea to write a program to track the mileage on my running shoes, so I could easily figure out when it was time to replace them. To do this, I had to pull my data from Strava, and while trying to figure out how to do that, I realized I could access quite a lot of data about my runs.

I've written scripts to pull all my Strava activities and catalog all the data points I care about. I was able to make some maps of where I've been running.

I started running when the pandemic hit back in March. This is a map of most of the runs I did around home during those first few months.

Here's a map of some run's I did at my undergrad campus, UConnn (Go Huskies!). Horesebarn Hill will always be one of my favorite places to run.

And lastly, since I've moved to Ohio, here are all of my runs (except one trail run that was too far away to be included on this map).

I'm looking forward to playing around with data visualization. I'd like to make some heatmaps and overlay them on real maps of the area's I'm running in. I'll have to look into that.
