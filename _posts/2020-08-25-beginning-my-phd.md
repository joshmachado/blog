## Who let this happen?

This is a strange time for a lot of reasons, on both a global and personal level. But, this week I started my PhD program and I'm really excited about all of it. I'm only a few days in but am starting the process of choosing my first year research project. I'm looking forward to it, but I'm unsure how to choose.

## What's better?

Is it better to branch out and try something new, or choose a project in the field I've already established a semi-working knowledge of? I've only ever worked with radio astronomy, specifically galactic star formation - and I've loved it. I'm excited at the idea of learning more about radio astronomy, but who know's if I'd end up loving something else even more.

I'm not sure what I'll end up doing. I'm planning to basically ask everyone I talk to what their advice is. Either way, I'm looking forward to whatever it is I'll be working on next.
